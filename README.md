Let's dive into the world of SQL for Ad Tech!


With the learning plan laid out and your Git repository synchronized with GitHub, the best place to begin is right at the beginning: **Day 1 of the "Week 1 - Basics" section.**

Here's a suggested starting point and how to proceed:

1.  **Navigate to the `exercises` directory:** In your local `sql-for-adtech` repository, find the `exercises` directory.

2.  **Open `questions.md`:** Inside the `exercises` directory, open the `questions.md` file in a text editor or Markdown viewer.

3.  **Start with Day 1:** The `questions.md` file is structured with practice questions for each day. Begin by reading the questions for **Day 1: Introduction to SQL & SELECT Statements.**

4.  **Refer to the `queries` directory (if needed):** If you're unsure how to approach a question, you can look at the corresponding file in the `queries` directory (e.g., `queries/day1-queries.sql`). These files contain example SQL queries related to the topics of the day, which might provide hints or guidance.

5.  **Practice SQL:**
    * **Set up a practice environment:** If you haven't already, set up one of the free SQL practice platforms mentioned in the `resources.md` file (e.g., SQLiteOnline, dbfiddle, or install SQLite locally).
    * **Create the sample tables:** You'll need to create the `impressions` and `campaigns` tables in your practice environment and load the data from the `datasets` directory (`impressions.csv` and `campaigns.csv`). The structure of these tables should be evident from the `CREATE TABLE` statements likely present in the `queries/day1-queries.sql` or subsequent day's queries, or you can infer it from the column names in the CSV files.
    * **Write and execute your SQL queries:** For each question in `exercises/questions.md` for Day 1, write the corresponding SQL query in your practice environment and execute it to see the results.

6.  **Check your answers:** After attempting the questions for Day 1, you can compare your results with the solutions provided in the `solutions` directory in the file `solutions/day1-solutions.sql`.

7.  **Proceed day by day:** Follow this process for each day of the learning plan. Move on to Day 2 after you feel comfortable with the concepts and questions from Day 1, and so on.

**Key things to keep in mind as you begin:**

* **Pace yourself:** The plan is designed for about 30 minutes per day. Don't feel pressured to rush through the material.
* **Experiment:** Don't just copy the example queries. Try modifying them and see what happens. Experimenting is a great way to deepen your understanding.
* **Refer to resources:** If you're stuck on a concept, don't hesitate to consult the `resources.md` file for links to additional learning materials and platforms.
* **Ask questions (to an AI assistant or colleagues):** If you encounter concepts that are particularly confusing, don't be afraid to ask for clarification.

**In short, start with the Day 1 questions in `exercises/questions.md`, use the example queries in the `queries` directory as a guide if needed, practice writing and executing SQL in a free online platform using the data in the `datasets` directory, and then check your answers against the solutions in the `solutions` directory. Good luck with your SQL learning journey\!**

## Day 14 â€“ Putting It All Together - Mini Project

### Goal
Apply the SQL skills learned over the past two weeks to analyze a more complex ad tech scenario.

### Dataset
Use the `impressions.csv` and `campaigns.csv` datasets.

### Project Description

You are an analyst at an ad tech company. Your task is to analyze the performance of different campaigns and creatives based on the available impression data. You need to answer the following questions:

1.  What is the total number of impressions, total clicks, and the overall Click-Through Rate (CTR) for each campaign?
2.  Which campaign has the highest number of impressions?
3.  What is the average viewability rate for each campaign?
4.  Identify the top 3 creatives with the highest number of clicks across all campaigns.
5.  How does the CTR vary by device type?
6.  Are there any campaigns that have a significantly lower than average viewability rate?
7.  Bonus: Can you identify any trends in impression volume over the available dates?

### Tasks

Write SQL queries to answer each of the questions above. You may need to use various SQL concepts you've learned, including:

- `SELECT` and `FROM`
- `WHERE` for filtering
- `GROUP BY` for aggregation
- Aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`)
- `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` for ranking
- `JOIN` to combine data from `impressions` and `campaigns`
- `CASE` statements for conditional analysis
- CTEs to structure your queries

### Deliverable

Submit a document or a series of SQL queries that answer each of the questions. Explain your logic for each query.

This mini-project will help you solidify your understanding of SQL and its application in analyzing ad tech data. Good luck\!

## Day 13 â€“ Conditional Logic with CASE Statements

### Topics
- Understanding the `CASE` statement for conditional logic
- Creating new categories or flags based on data values
- Using `CASE` in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and aggregate functions

### Ad Tech Relevance
Categorizing campaigns based on performance (e.g., high/medium/low CTR). Flagging potential issues based on certain conditions (e.g., very low viewability). Creating custom groupings for analysis.

### Tools
- [Mode Analytics SQL Tutorial](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-case-statements/) - Learn about `CASE` statements.
- Look for examples of using `CASE` for data categorization in analytics.

### Practice Dataset
Use the `impressions.csv` dataset.

### Examples

**1. Categorizing impressions as "Clicked" or "Not Clicked":**

```sql
SELECT impression_id,
       CASE
           WHEN clicked = 1 THEN 'Clicked'
           ELSE 'Not Clicked'
       END AS click_status
FROM impressions;
```

**2. Categorizing devices:**

```sql
SELECT impression_id, device,
       CASE device
           WHEN 'mobile' THEN 'Mobile Device'
           WHEN 'desktop' THEN 'Desktop Device'
           ELSE 'Other'
       END AS device_category
FROM impressions;
```

**3. Counting impressions by click status:**

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN clicked = 1 THEN 'Clicked'
        ELSE 'Not Clicked'
    END AS click_status,
    COUNT(*) AS num_impressions
FROM impressions
GROUP BY click_status;
```

### Practice Questions

Using the `impressions.csv` dataset:

1.  Categorize viewability as "Viewed" (if `viewable` is 1) and "Not Viewed" (if `viewable` is 0).
2.  Create a new column that categorizes `campaign_id` 'campaign_A' as "Promo Campaign" and all others as "Standard Campaign".
3.  Count the number of impressions for each device category ('Mobile Device', 'Desktop Device', 'Other').
4.  Create a column that flags impressions as "High Engagement" if they were clicked and viewed, and "Low Engagement" otherwise.
5.  Order the impressions so that clicked impressions appear before not clicked impressions.
